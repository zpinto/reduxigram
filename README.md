# Reduxigram

A simple React + Redux implementation of a website that tries to replicate some of Instagram's features. I completed this project tutorial in order to learn Redux.

## Running

First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies.

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:7770> in your browser.

## Production Build

Run `npm build` to create a distro folder and a bundle.js file.
